## Lab26   Beginning TaskMaster

### Home Page

The main page should be built out to match the wireframe. In particular, it should have a heading at the top of the page, an image to mock the “my tasks” view, and buttons at the bottom of the page to allow going to the “add tasks” and “all tasks” page.

### Add Task Page

On the “Add a Task” page, allow users to type in details about a new task, specifically a title and a body. When users click the “submit” button, show a “submitted!” label on the page.

### All Tasks Page

The all tasks page should just be an image with a back button; it needs no functionality.

## Lab34 Amplify and DynamoDB
Feature Tasks
Tasks Are Cloudy
Using the amplify add api command, create a Task resource that replicates our existing Task schema. Update all references to the Task data to instead use AWS Amplify to access your data in DynamoDB instead of in Room.

Add Task Form
Modified my Add Task form to save the data entered in as a Task to DynamoDB.
